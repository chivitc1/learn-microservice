## User Story 01
As a user of the application, I want to be presented with a random
multiplication that I can solve onlineâ€”not too easy, so I can use mental
calculation and make my brain work every day.

TODO:
1. Create a basic service with the business logic.
2. Create a basic API endpoint to access this service
(REST API).
3. Create a basic web page to ask the users to solve that
calculation
